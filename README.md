# FunctionalGear
FunctionalGear for FiveM is a resource that allows certain clothing, props, and other gear items more than cosmetic functionality.



This resource does quite a few things:
1. Makes fire turnout/bunker gear fireproof and steamproof.  When wearing the clothes specified in the config, your firemen will take no damage from fire or steam and will not catch on fire when walking through flames.
2. Scuba gear makes player drownproof.  This was added due to an occasional bug that causes the player to drown while underwater and wearing the scuba gear.
3. Bomb gear makes player bombproof, fireproof, and steamproof.  Perfect for EOD, your players will actually be protected when disarming or disposing of active explosives!
4. Functional night vision and thermal goggles.  When set properly, you can turn the thermal or night vision goggles on and off with a keypress.  Doing this also makes the goggles go from the up (not-in-use) position to the down (in-use/in front of eyes) position.  This uses the default GTA night vision and thermal timecycle modifiers.
5. Detects and makes usable the gear light commonly attached to the fire bunker/turnout gear and scuba rig.  Light turns on and off with a keypress.
6. Stops peds accessories and props (hats, glasses, ear accessories, masks, etc) from falling off when taking damage from melee or other sources.



Files:
1. fxmanifest.lua --its the manifest ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2. config.lua --Config file where you can set a bunch of stuff.  I did this to make it easier to configure for different frameworks or EUP versions.  Thank me and call me daddy.
3. client.lua --where the magic happens.  you can change stuff in here at your own risk but no support will be offered.



All files have been heavily commented with explanations of what functions do or what lines in the config are for.  It should be pretty simple to figure out as this is literally my second script and I am no haxor.  I am happy to add functionality if people have any ideas.
